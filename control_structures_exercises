# This is the exercises for the control structures.

#1 Conditinal basics
    #a prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is Monday or not

day = input('Please enter day of the week:'):
print('Today is, ' + x);
    #b prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is a weekday or a weekend

    #c create variables and make up values for and write the python code that calculates the weekly paycheck. You get paid time and a half if you work more than 40 hours



            # the number of hours worked in one week
            # the hourly rate
            # how much the week's paycheck will be

#2 Loop Basics

    #A While
        # Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
        # Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
        # Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.
        i = 5
        while i <= 15:
            print(i)
            i +=1;

    #Create a while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.
   
        i = 0
        while i <= 100:
            print(i)
            i += 2;
    
    # Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.
         i = 100
         while i >= -10:
            print(i)
            i -= 5;
    # Create a while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 1,000,000. Output should equal:
            i = 2
            while i < 100000:
                print(i**2)
                i *=i;
    # Write a loop that uses print to create the output shown below.

#B For Loops
    #Write some code that prompts the user for a number, then shows a multiplication table up through 10 for that number.

for i in the range(1,10):
print (i)
